# imageTransformations
A React JS app for performing transformations on images.
The various types of transformations allowed currently are :

1.Resize <br />
2.Adding image header <br />
3.Adding image footer 

From the homepage, select any transformation and proceed with uploading the images by clicking on the <img src='https://i.imgur.com/HCNHXNI.png' width='40px' height='40px' > icon.<br />
Once the uploading is done, move forward and provide the relevant details needed for the transformations such as, width and height(in pixels).
<br />
<br />
For <b>Resize</b>, only image and the new dimensions(width and height) are needed.<br />
<br />
For Adding <b>Header</b> and <b>Footer</b>, two images have to be uploaded (base image and header/footer) along with width and height in pixels (The default values of width and height are 100% and 10%). <br />
As soon as you are done with providing the information, you can click on the <img src='https://i.imgur.com/AN1CALS.png' width='100px' height='40px' >  button and the result will be shown in the right side section of the page.

You can click the <img src='https://i.imgur.com/dVA2wLF.png' width='70px' height='40px' > button anytime to return to the homepage.
